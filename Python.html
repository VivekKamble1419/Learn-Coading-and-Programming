        <h1>Python</h1>
        <h2>What is Python?</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first
            released in 1991. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it one of the most
            popular programming languages in the world.
            Python is used in a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data
            analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, scripting, and more. Its versatility and
            simplicity make it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers alike.

        <h2>Here are some key features of Python:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Readability: Python emphasizes code readability and uses a clean and straightforward syntax. It uses
                indentation and whitespace to define code blocks, which makes it easy to understand and write.
            </li>

            <li>Easy to learn and use: Python is designed to be beginner-friendly, with a relatively simple syntax and a
                large standard library that provides many pre-built functions and modules. This makes it easier to write
                and read code, reducing the learning curve for new programmers.
            </li>

            <li> Interpreted and interactive: Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed
                line by line without the need for explicit compilation. It also provides an interactive shell, known as
                the Python interpreter, which allows for quick prototyping and experimentation.
            </li>

            <li>Cross-platform compatibility: Python is available on various operating systems, including Windows,
                macOS, and Linux, making it highly portable. Python programs can run unchanged on different platforms,
                as long as the required Python interpreter is available.</li>

            <li>Extensive standard library and ecosystem: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that
                provides modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, networking, regular expressions, and more.
                Additionally, Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks that expand its
                capabilities, enabling developers to easily build complex applications.</li>
