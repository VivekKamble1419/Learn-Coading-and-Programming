        <h1>C programming</h1>
        <h2>What is C programming ?</h2>
        <p>C programming is a programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
            It is a general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency, low-level access to memory, and close
            relationship with the underlying hardware.

            C is widely used in various domains, including systems programming, embedded systems, operating systems,
            game development, and scientific applications. It provides a structured and procedural approach to
            programming, allowing developers to write efficient and portable code.</p>

        <h2>Some key features of C programming include:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Syntax: C has a relatively simple syntax compared to some other programming languages. It uses a combination
            of keywords, operators, and control structures to write code.</li>

        <li>Pointers: C allows direct manipulation of memory addresses through the use of pointers. Pointers are
            variables that store memory addresses, and they enable efficient memory management and low-level access to
            data.</li>

        <li> Standard Libraries: C provides a standard library that includes various functions for tasks like
            input/output, string manipulation, memory management, and mathematical operations. These libraries provide a
            set of pre-defined functions that can be used in C programs.</li>

        <li>Portability: C programs can be compiled and executed on different platforms with minimal changes. This
            portability makes C a popular choice for cross-platform development.</li>

        <li>Efficiency: C is known for its efficiency and performance. It allows direct access to hardware resources,
            efficient memory management, and fine-grained control over program execution.</li>

        <li>To write and run C programs, you need a C compiler, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang. The
            compiler translates the C code into machine code that can be executed by the computer's processor.</li>
        </ol>
