        <h2>What is Ruby?</h2>
        <p>Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability. It
            was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known as Matz, with the goal of combining the best
            features of various programming languages.

            Ruby has a clean and elegant syntax that emphasizes natural language-like constructs, making it easy to read
            and write. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional
            programming. Ruby is also a dynamically typed language, which means that variable types are determined at
            runtime.

        <h2>Here are some key features of the Ruby programming language:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Object-Oriented: Ruby is a fully object-oriented language, where everything is an object. It supports
                classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing for modular and reusable code.
            </li>

            <li>Dynamic Typing: Ruby is dynamically typed, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime. You
                don't need to specify the type of a variable explicitly, making it flexible and enabling rapid
                development.
            </li>

            <li> Garbage Collection: Ruby has automatic memory management through a garbage collector. It takes care of
                allocating and freeing up memory, making memory management easier for developers.
            </li>

            <li>Duck Typing: Ruby follows the principle of "duck typing," which means that the type or class of an
                object is less important than the methods it supports. As long as an object responds to the necessary
                methods, it can be used interchangeably.
            </li>
            Blocks and Closures: Ruby has a powerful feature called blocks, which are chunks of code that can be passed
            around and executed later. Blocks, combined with closures (which remember the context in which they were
            created), enable elegant and concise coding patterns.
        </li>


        </ol>
