        <h1>Database</h1>
        <h2>What is Database?</h2>
        <p> A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage,
            retrieval, and manipulation of information. It can be thought of as an electronic filing system where data
            is
            stored in tables, with each table containing a specific type of information. Databases are used in a wide
            variety of applications, from simple record-keeping to complex systems used for managing large amounts of
            data
            in businesses, organizations, and institutions. Some common examples of databases include customer databases
            used in marketing, inventory databases used in retail, and medical databases used in healthcare. The main
            advantages of databases are their ability to organize large amounts of data efficiently, their ability to
            enforce data consistency and accuracy, and their ability to support multiple users accessing the same data
            simultaneously.

        <h2>Use of Database</h2>

        <p>
            Efficient storage and retrieval of data: Databases are designed to efficiently store and retrieve large
            amounts of data. They use complex indexing algorithms and data structures to enable fast access to specific
            pieces of information, even when dealing with millions of records.

            Data consistency and accuracy: Databases enforce rules and constraints that ensure the consistency and
            accuracy of data stored within them. For example, a database may enforce a rule that prevents duplicate
            records from being inserted, or it may require that certain fields be filled in before a record can be
            saved.

            Data sharing: Databases can be used to share data between different applications and users. Multiple users
            can access the same data simultaneously, and changes made by one user are immediately visible to others.

            Data security: Databases can be secured using various techniques, such as access control, encryption, and
            backup and recovery procedures. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and data loss.

            Business intelligence: Databases can be used to store and analyze large amounts of data, which can be used
            to generate insights and inform decision-making. For example, a retail business may use a database to track
            sales data and generate reports on customer buying patterns.

        <h2>SQL</h2>
        <p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating
            relational databases. SQL provides a standardized way to communicate with databases, allowing users to
            perform various operations such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data.

        <h2>MongoDB</h2>
        <p>MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database system that stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. It
            offers scalability, flexibility, and high performance for modern applications. It is widely used in web and
            mobile applications, providing features like powerful indexing, automatic sharding, and support for complex
            queries. MongoDB is often used alongside technologies like Node.js, React, and AWS for building scalable and
            efficient systems.</p>
