        <h1>JAVA</h1>
        <h2>What is JAVA?</h2>
        <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned
            by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java
            programs can run on any operating system or device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

            Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" principle, which allows developers to write Java code once
            and then execute it on multiple platforms without the need for recompilation. This is achieved through the
            use of the JVM, which acts as an intermediary between the Java code and the underlying operating system.</p>

        <h2>Some key features of Java include:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Object-oriented: Java follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, which means that it
                provides features like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>

            <li>Platform independence: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any system
                that has a compatible JVM installed. This makes Java highly portable.</li>

            <li> Garbage collection: Java has an automatic memory management system that handles the allocation and
                deallocation of memory. Developers don't need to manually allocate and free memory, as the JVM takes
                care of it through garbage collection.</li>

            <li>Strong standard library: Java comes with a vast standard library that provides ready-to-use classes and
                methods for common tasks, such as input/output, networking, database connectivity, and much more. This
                makes Java development efficient and productive.</li>

            <li>Security: Java has built-in security features that help protect against malicious code. The JVM includes
                a security manager that can control access to system resources and restrict potentially harmful
                operations.</li>

        </ol>
